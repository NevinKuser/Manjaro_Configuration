# Manjaro_Configuration

Hello dear friends, 

This is the list of commands that I run after a fresh Manjaro Linux install. You can follow the list of commands from top to bottom to get this exact 
configuration. This is for a nice, clean, and fast workspace computer. 

Please note that I have an Nvidia T600 video card. The drivers are automatically
included in the Manjaro installation these days under the NOUVEAU driver. In the past it was more difficult and painful. 
You may need to do some extra work searching to install your video card drivers. 

Also note that I have a paid $120 3 year tunnelbear subscription and that's why I mentioned it. Use whatever VPN you prefer if you even need one at all.
